# Machine-Learning-for-astronomy (Kmeans and GMM from Scratch)

Data set consists of 2 images of deep sky taken in June and another one in December. The goal is to cluster stars nearby to our galaxy in a single cluster and the distant ones in another cluster. The coordinated of the stars are obtained from which the disparity matrix is calculated. This disparity data set is the difference in x coordinates of each start over the 2 images (i.e. over 6 months). My clustering algorithm works over the phenomenon that stars nearer to us will have higher displacements as compared to stars farther away from us (parallax!).
K means and GMM both are run give the results.
